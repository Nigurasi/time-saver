### TIME SAVER

## tl;dr
An unbeliably awesome extension for Mozilla Firefox. Should've work on Chrome but it just doesn't. We've lost 7 hours of our lives trying to figure it out. 

## Description
An extension for websites made to punish You for entertainment and having fun. Just kidding(or are we?). Made to increase Your productivity. 


Time saver measures time you spend on every website and makes sure your procrastination monkey is starving to death.

But how it really works?

Let's assume you spend on Reddit 2 hours per day. It's 14 hours per week. About 420 hours per month. You could be doing so many productive things in that
time like learning javascript or creating a family of rubber ducks. Here comes Time saver. You decide to spend on reddit only 5 hours per week and our extension 
watches over you to help you with your resolution. If you exceed your allowed time, your site will be block and instead of it you will see deadly cats. Real murderers.
You don't want to see it. It's terrifying.

You say that you will delete the extension?

Ha, nope. Well... Now you can do it but in future update, you won't be able to do it if you exceed your allowed time. Think about it like a prison for reddit. But without 
a way to get out. You won't become another Andy Dufresne.
